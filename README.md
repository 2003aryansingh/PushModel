# Push Model Demo Repository

This repository contains a simple demonstration of the push model, a server-to-client communication technique used in web development for real-time updates.

## Description

The push model is a technique where the server actively pushes updates to the clients without the clients explicitly requesting for them. It allows for real-time communication between the server and clients, enabling immediate updates without the need for constant client-side polling.

This demonstration repository includes a sample web application that showcases the push model using websockets.
